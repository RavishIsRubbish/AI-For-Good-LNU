## Programs

### 1. Image Protection Software

Protecting the work of artists from unauthorized usage is a paramount concern. Our Image Protection Software aims to safeguard artists' creations from being misused by AI art programs.

### 2. AI Image Detector

The AI Image Detector is designed to identify and analyze images, contributing to various applications such as content moderation, object recognition, and more.

### 3. AI Art Assistant

Acknowledging the need to respect artist rights, our AI Image Generator creates new images without utilizing protected artworks. This ensures a responsible and ethical approach to AI-generated content.
